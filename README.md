Let's get right down to it...:-)

ABOUT THE SYSTEM
This is a booking system that was created by Mr SB Jamile, in 2021, for companies such as ICC. Booking systems try to solve the issue of double booking. It wouldn't
be great for business if 2 clients were to book their services on the same day and at the same time, with their limited resources. This system handles bookings
of venues, equipment (Sound and Lighting), and furniture. Discounts are also provided.

MAIN PAGE
This is the first page that you'd see when you run the program. It has the links to all the other parts of the system, and it includes access control for the general
staff, and Admin staff. This access control is controled by the input password. 
When a user logs in, they will be required to enter their Username (email) and their password. These datails will be checked against the database, and if they're correct, the
user will be allowed to have access to the system as per their role (general staff/Admin). If the log in details are incorrect, the error will be handled correctly. The system
will provide an error message indicating such, and the user will be promted to enter the correct details.
At this point, they will also be allowed to close the system.

BOOKING
Well, this is the page that holds the main functionality of the entire system. With so many buttons, checkboxed, radio buttons, labels, and text boxes; through this page, an employee will
be able to make a booking for a client. The client would have to be registered in the system for them to make a booking (for that, the employee will have to go to the cutomer page). All of these 
details are stored in the database if and only if all the details are correct, and there is no booking that has already been made on the selected day. When a booking is been made, a client
is not allowed to book the current day, or any date that is before the current date. Negative bookings are also not allowed. Negative bookings in this context are when the end time of the booking is
before the start time. Each venue, equipment, and furniture has it's own price that cannot be changed (unless changed by the manager). Through the booking process, the prices are added and displayed 
at the bottom of the page. The tax is also calculated, and the employee can prompt the system to give a client a discount if a dicsount is needed.
Each venue also has a limited number of guests that it can have at one moment, this information is displayed at the top.

CUSTOMER & EMPLOYEE
These two forms work in an identical way, difference being that one is for cutomers and the other is for employees. A customer/empoyee can be added and removed, and thier infomration
can also be updated and saved into the database.

What you could implement, if you decide to upgrade this system, is to allow the system to keep track of the time that each empoyee uses the system. So that at the end of the month, this infomation can 
be used as a way to pay the employee for the number of hours worked.

View Booking
Through this page, you can see all of the bookings that have been made in the past, right up to the last booking made. These bookings can also be updated just incase a client
wants to change the booking date. For instances where a client wants to cancel the booking, that action can also be done through this page.


That's it for the system.
Happy Coding :-)
